### Understanding WordPress Custom Queries

WordPress custom queries allow us to fetch specific data from usr WordPress database, beyond the default behavior. This is particularly useful when we want to display posts or pages based on custom criteria, such as posts from a specific category, posts by a particular author, or even custom post types.

Imagine we have got a custom html page setup as usr home or `front-page` or wordpress site. now, user styling may allow the users to peek into blog entries and show 2 latest blog enerties styled nicely on the front page. if you want to connect your wordpress DB to show latest blog entries on that page, you will need to make use of custom query.Custom query allows us to fetch data on-demand from various parts of wordpress, and plug it into "view" or "pages" across entire site.

### What is a Query in WordPress?

A query in WordPress is a request to the database for specific information. By default, WordPress runs a query to fetch posts and pages to display them according to default theme's settings. However, we can customize these queries to suit our needs.

### Why Use Custom Queries?

Custom queries are useful when we need to:
Custom queries are useful when we need to:

- Display posts from a specific category.
- Show posts by a particular author.
- Fetch custom post types.
- Display posts based on custom fields.

### Using WP_Query

The `WP_Query` class in WordPress allows us to create custom queries. Here’s a basic code example:

```php
<?php
// Define the custom query
$args = array(
    'post_type' => 'post', // Post type
    'posts_per_page' => 5, // Number of posts to display
    'category_name' => 'news' // Category slug
);

// Execute the custom query
$custom_query = new WP_Query($args);

// The Loop
if ($custom_query->have_posts()) :
    while ($custom_query->have_posts()) : $custom_query->the_post();
        // Display post content
        the_title('<h2>', '</h2>');
        the_excerpt();
    endwhile;
else :
    echo 'No posts found';
endif;

// Reset post data
wp_reset_postdata();
?>
```

### Explanation

- **Define the Query Parameters**: The `$args` array specifies the criteria for the query. In this example, we are fetching the latest 5 posts from the ‘news’ category.
- **Execute the Query**: `new WP_Query($args)` creates a new query object based on the specified parameters.
- **The Loop**: This is where we display the fetched posts. `have_posts()` checks if there are posts matching the query, and `the_post()` sets up the post data.
- **Reset Post Data**: `wp_reset_postdata()` ensures that the global `$post` object is restored to the main query.

### Footnotes

Wordpress Custom Queries are such a nifty feature that using these truly unlocks the power of custom wordpress development. Happy Querying until next time!
